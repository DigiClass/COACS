# COACS project outline #

**Project timetable:**

 * Months 1-3: survey of AWOL content and harvesting of top-level metadata (journals);
 * Months 4-6: creation of intermediate data format, and harvesting of subordinate-level data (articles);
 * Months 7-9: survey of other OA indexes and first ingest into ICS catalogue;
 * Months 10-12: consolidate metadata harvesting; document and publish data and code.

**By the end of the pilot project, we will have:**

 * made available and documented the intermediate dataset and harvesting and ingest code;
 * performed a test ingest of the data into the ICS library catalogue;
 * engaged known (NYU, Zenon, BL) and newly discovered colleagues in potentially adding to and using this data;
 * explored the possibility of seeking external funding to take this project further.
