The visual heritage project is an initiative to increase documentation on at-risk archaeological sites through crowd sourcing image collection. The project takes an innovative approach to delivering this media by harnessing public data from social media and archival records. Through pairing these images, the project provides a visual tour of history. Viewers can scroll through years of development as the images associated with the sites evolve over time. The site offers a unique research tool for both the hobbyist and historian.00avisualheritageproject.weebly.comdhttp://visualheritageproject.weebly.com/uhttp://visualheritageproject.weebly.com/
