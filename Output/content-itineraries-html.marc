The Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae Digital Collection. The Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae is a collection of engravings of Rome and Roman antiquities, the core of which consists of prints published by Antonio Lafreri and gathered under a title page he printed in the mid-1570's. Copies of the Speculum vary greatly in the number of prints, and individual prints were reissued and changed over time. The University of Chicago Library's copy of the Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae contains nearly 1,000 prints and is the largest in the world. The Library's copy arrived in the 1890's as a part of the Berlin Collection, a large lot of books and manuscripts purchased for the Library from S. Calvary and Co. in Berlin. A list of sources from the 1973 catalog is available here.00aspeculum.lib.uchicago.edudhttp://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/uhttp://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/content/itineraries.html
