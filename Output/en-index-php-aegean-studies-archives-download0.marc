Aegean Studies accepts papers which present new theoretical approaches and innovative means of data analysis with the aim of illuminating and explaining the prehistory and early Iron Age of the Aegean and its neighbouring areas. Especially welcome are interdisciplinary contributions, as well as studies for the promotion and management of prehistoric culture. The Aegean Book Reviews are part of Aegean Studies. Texts are accepted in Greek and in English. All papers are submitted to anonymous reviewing. They are initially published electronically on the Aegeus website, and, together with the Aegean Book Reviews, in an annual printed volume of Aegean Studies.00awww.aegeussociety.orgdhttp://www.aegeussociety.org/en/index.php/aegean-studies/archivesuhttp://www.aegeussociety.org/en/index.php/aegean-studies/archives#download0
