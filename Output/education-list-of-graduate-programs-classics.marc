The Guide to Graduate Programs in the Classics is a project of the American Philological Association’s Committee on Education. During the past year the APA has decided to make this resource primarily an electronic publication so that it can be updated more frequently. As a temporary measure, a list of departments offering graduate programs appears below. Over the summer we hope to install a new database that will enable departments to submit and change as necessary the detailed information that has traditionally appeared in the Guide, e. g. , degrees offered, fees, and areas of faculty expertise. As you will see, the listing below consists of a table showing which graduate degree(s) in Classics each institution offers, with the name of the institution serving as a link to the relevant department’s web site. Please send any corrections to this list to, using the subject heading Graduate Program List Update.00aclassicalstudies.orgdhttps://classicalstudies.org/education/list-of-graduate-programs-classicsuhttps://classicalstudies.org/education/list-of-graduate-programs-classics
