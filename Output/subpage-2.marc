Welcome! This website is the hub for members of the American Oriental Society (AOS) who are currently graduate students or who have graduated recently. Being a graduate student or recent alumna/us is a vulnerable position in any field, but the fields represented by AOS are often quite small, making support and resources difficult to find. With this website, we aim to provide you with a community within AOS to help you navigate your field, connect with your peers, and aid your transition from student to scholar.00aaosgrads.yale.edudhttp://aosgrads.yale.edu/uhttp://aosgrads.yale.edu/subpage-2
