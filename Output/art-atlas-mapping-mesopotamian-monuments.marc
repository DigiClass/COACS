A work in progress, this monument survey covers all historical periods from ancient to modern. It includes ancient Mesopotamian rock reliefs carved into the cliff faces of the mountains, early Christian churches and monasteries, early Islamic, Ottoman and twentieth century architecture and monuments. This database of images invites you to explore the multiple layers of the rich historical landscape of Mesopotamia. Envisioned and directed by Professor Zainab Bahrani, the basis of the survey is an on-going field project that assesses the condition of monuments, maps their locations and records them with digital techniques in order to provide a record and to facilitate future preservation work across this region.00amcid.mcah.columbia.edudhttps://mcid.mcah.columbia.edu/art-atlas/mapping-mesopotamian-monumentsuhttps://mcid.mcah.columbia.edu/art-atlas/mapping-mesopotamian-monuments
