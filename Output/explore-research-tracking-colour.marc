Greek and Roman marble statues were not set up in blazing white. They were colourful. We are now on the track of the colours that remain on sculptures in our collection. The research project now under way in the Glyptotek is the first of its kind. The aim is to identify, document and study traces of colour on our Greek and Roman sculptures.00awww.glyptoteket.comdhttp://www.glyptoteket.com/explore/research/tracking-colouruhttp://www.glyptoteket.com/explore/research/tracking-colour00a-
