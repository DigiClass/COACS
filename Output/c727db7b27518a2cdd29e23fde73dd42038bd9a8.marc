E. Johnson, University of South Florida. By late antiquity, the status of women fell into three divisions: marriage, widowhood, or celibacy. In the eyes of intellectual early Christians, these states were not of equal merit. Specifically, Jerome viewed virginity as the most holy state, then widowhood, followed by marriage. However, his deprecation of marriage can appear so potent and his asceticism so extreme that modern scholars struggle to provide a balanced analysis of Jerome’s works. The focus of scholars on these two aspects of Jerome’s works restricts them from the wider spectrum of judgments Jerome has about the above three states. Analyzing his premier works on virginity - Letter 22, Against Jovinian, and Against Helvidius - I will show that Jerome offers readers not only a three-tier hierarchy, but also an elaborate "grid," identifying the "good" and "bad" virgin, spouse, and widow. Additionally, I will demonstrate the necessity for this detailed grid by arguing that its components were evident in Jerome’s construction of Paula’s chaste sanctity in his hagiography of her. The nuance and detail Jerome infuses into all of his works should be equally appreciated in his judgments on not only virginity, but also widowhood and marriage.00awww.vexillumjournal.orgdhttp://www.vexillumjournal.org/uhttp://www.vexillumjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Johnson-Defining-Excellence-A-Grid-of-Jerome%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9CGood%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9CBad%E2%80%9D-Virgin-Spouse-and-Widow.pdf
