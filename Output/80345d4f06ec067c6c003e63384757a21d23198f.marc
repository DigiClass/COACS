Our aim is to provide a high quality peer-reviewed journal, where postgraduates at any stage in their career can publish notes or articles pertaining to the classical world. We do not discriminate and so not only welcome submissions in Classical literature, but also from archaeology to reception, and everything in-between. We are excited to announce that our first issue is now available!. You can access it from the Issues page by either clicking the link or using the toolbar above. Issue 1: 16/09/16. Editorial 1 J.
