Welcome to PIE Lexicon Pilot 1. 1: The generative etymological dictionary of Anatolian languages. Proto-Indo-European Lexicon is the generative etymological dictionary of Indo-European languages. The current version, PIE Lexicon Pilot 1. 1, presents digitally generated data of hundred most ancient Indo-European languages with three hundred new etymologies for Old Anatolian languages, Hitttite, Palaic, Cuneiform Luwian and Hieroglyphic Luwian, arranged under two hundred Indo-European roots. The correspondences contain data of all fourteen sub-branches of the Indo-European languages, Albanian, Anatolian, Armenian, Baltic, Celtic, Germanic, Greek, Indo-Aryan, Iranian, Italic, Old Balkan (Satem), Old Balkan (Centum), Slavic and Tocharian. The Anatolian etymologies have been chosen due to their particularly problematic nature, and in the absence of other criteria the selection is random. However, as all the oldest forms of the languages are represented in the data, the ancient languages still absent in PIE Lexicon are supplemented in the near future.00apielexicon.hum.helsinki.fidhttp://pielexicon.hum.helsinki.fi/uhttp://pielexicon.hum.helsinki.fi/?alpha=ALL
