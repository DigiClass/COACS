By the end of 2012, with over nine-hundred gems present and more than thirty collections represented in the database, a fourth of the known corpus of magical gems has become accessible, while we are presently working on the upload of a similar amount. As the integration of new material naturally necessitates changes, having got this far, we have started to reconsider certain features of the database, to review what has been achieved until now and launch improvements in order to create not simply a corpus of magical gems, but also a research tool. Our research on magical gems worldwide has been made possible by the ongoing support of Vacheron Constantin, Geneva. A standard grant of the International Visegrad Fund has allowed us to concentrate on ’Magical Gems in the Visegrad Countries’. The Newsletters of CBd were discontinued from 22 January 2016.
