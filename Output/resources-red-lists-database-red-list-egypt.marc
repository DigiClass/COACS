List of object categories Context Acknowledgements Support Legislation Bilateral agreements Press release Download red list Contacts The fight against illicit traffic in cultural goods requires the enhancement of both legal instruments and practical tools disseminating information and raising public awareness. The Emergency Red List of Egyptian Cultural Objects at Risk aims to help art and heritage professionals and law enforcement officials identify Egyptian objects that are protected by national and international legislations. In order to facilitate identification, the Emergency Red List describes the categories or types of cultural items that are most likely to be illegally bought and sold. Museums, auction houses, art dealers and collectors are encouraged not to acquire these objects without having carefully and thoroughly researched their origin and all the relevant legal documentation. Due to the great diversity of objects, styles and periods, the Emergency Red List of Egyptian Cultural Objects at Risk is far from exhaustive. Any cultural good that could have originated in Egypt should be subjected to detailed scrutiny and precautionary measures.
