Welcome to the homepage of the Corpus of Ptolemaic Inscriptions (CPI) project, which aims to create a Corpus of up-to-date editions of the Greek, bilingual and trilingual inscriptions on stone from Ptolemaic Egypt (323-30 BCE), numbering around 450 items, based on material collected and annotated by the late Peter Fraser FBA (1918-2007). The CPI project is funded by a grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and is based at the Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents in Oxford.00acpi.csad.ox.ac.ukdhttp://cpi.csad.ox.ac.uk/uhttp://cpi.csad.ox.ac.uk/
