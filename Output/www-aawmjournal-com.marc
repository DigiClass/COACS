The online journal Analytical Approaches to World Music (AAWM) aims to bring together analysts from a broad range of conceptual and cultural traditions in order to explore new modes of musical description and understanding capable of navigating the multicultural soundscape of the twenty-first century. In so doing, AAWM seeks to expand the potential for musical analysis from a cross-cultural perspective by applying diverse theoretical and analytical concepts to repertoires outside the Western art music tradition. We welcome submissions that examine world musical traditions from a wide variety of analytical and theoretical perspectives. These may include, but are not limited to: the adaptation of analytical approaches usually associated with Western art music to address various world music traditions; the use of indigenous analytical tools and strategies to characterize particular musical styles and genres; and the development of "hybrid" analytical systems and theories that integrate the aforementioned approaches. Furthermore, we whole-heartedly embrace research that encompasses various formal, cultural, aesthetic and philosophical analytical perspectives. It is our hope that by bringing together analysts from a broad range of conceptual and cultural traditions, new modes of musical description and understanding may emerge.
