Our primary purpose is to compile a complete list of the authors of such texts, be they grammarians, teachers, erudites or any other author who may have written works on grammar, regardless of their position in society or their literary activity. These authors have been frequently quoted by late Latin grammarians and their ideas contributed to the evolution of ancient linguistic thought. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in this field, but a complete corpus is not available and modern editors are confronted with the daunting task of locating the quotes within texts, delimitating them and only then analysing them. Readers can access relevant information on these fragmentary texts, including grammarians’ lives and works as well as an overview of each of these authors’ thought. As for the fragments themselves, they will be available in a new book edition in the near future, published by the FLG group. In the meantime, readers will be able to consult existing editions through the links provided here, in particular G. Funaioli’s (GRFF: Grammaticae Romanae Fragmenta, Leipzig1907), which covers the period from the beginning to the end of the Republic. A. Mazzarino’s edition (GRFM: Grammaticae Romanae Fragmenta aetatis Caesareae, Turin1955), which deals with the beginning of the imperial period, is not available on the internet. However, whenever possible, we provide alternative editions, like we do for the authors of the late imperial period, where no editions exist.00awww.corpusgl.eudhttp://www.corpusgl.eu/uhttp://www.corpusgl.eu/
