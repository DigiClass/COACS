Section d’Archéologie et d’Histoire. The magazine Annales d’Université „Valahia" Târgovişte. Section d’Archéologie et d’Histoire has appeared since 1999, representing an opportunity to valorize the research work of the academic staff from the History-Archeology Department, and also a chance to valorize the research work of the young teaching staff who carry out their activity at the Research Centers accredited by CNCSIS - „Preistorie, arheologie interdisciplinară şi conservarea patrimoniului cultural mobil" (Prehistory, Interdisciplinary Archeology and Conservation of the Movable Cultural Patrimony) and Centrul de Cercetare al Istoriei Relaţiilor Internaţionale „Grigore Gafencu" (The "Grigore Gafencu" Center for the Research of the History of the International Relations). For objective (especially financial) reasons, in order to maintain our quality standards, from the moment when the Annals of "Valahia" University began to appear on sections, sometimes we have published the results of two years of researches in a single tome, trying to preserve the continuity of the publication. Beginning with 2008, the magazine will appear with two annual issues. The themes have remained constant throughout the issues that were published so far in the domain of history and archeology, always covering all the historical periods - prehistory and archeology, history and archeology of the Middle Ages, modern and contemporary history. The structure of our magazine maintained its classical form: Articles and studies; Notes and Debates; Reviews. The standards of quality have been ensured by the presence in the Publishing Team and Advisory Board of the most representative personalities in the domain of research for each historical period, from Romania and abroad, in the sense that each contribution was submitted to the appreciation of the members of the magazine’s Publishing Team and Advisory Board by means of specialized reviews. The articles and studies published in the Annales d’Université „Valahia" Târgovişte, Section d’Archéologie et d’Histoire have been published integrally in a language of large international circulation (English, French, German, Italian), having a permanent scientific impact, in the sense that they have often been quoted in the studies of our colleagues from Romania and abroad. At the same time, Annales d’Université Valahia Targoviste, Section d’Archéologie et d’Histoire have been included in several international databases. The magazine is remarkable for its extremely original contributions in the domain of prehistoric archeology, produced by a school that has been acknowledged in its domain and whose results have been appreciated not just nationally but also internationally, given the fact that it has carried out many research programs in collaboration with numerous universities from Europe, like those from Liège, Bordeaux I, Aix-en-Provence, the Musée de l’Homme and the Institute of Human Paleontology from Paris, Erlanger and Köln University from Germany etc. The results of such researches have often been the topic of articles included in the Annales d’Université „Valahia" Targoviste, Section d’Archéologie et d’Histoire. At the same time, in this magazine can be found studies of many of our colleagues from other universities from Romania and abroad.
