Jim Crow, Sam Turner. In many areas of the Eastern Mediterranean there are landscapes exhibiting exceptional time-depth, where the historic landscape is made up of visible features from many different periods. Our research adapted and used a new technique developed in Britain (Historic Landscape Characterisation - HLC) for the first time in the eastern Mediterranean to study these landscapes. HLC is a method for mapping the landscape that can be used to interpret how and when different elements were created. Using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) we integrated data from historical, archaeological and other sources to create detailed, long-term landscape histories of two case-studies areas.00aarchaeologydataservice.ac.ukdhttp://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/easternmed_ahrc_2010uhttp://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/easternmed_ahrc_2010
