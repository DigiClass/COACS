"On the occasion of the twenty-first conference of the International Organization for the Study of the Old Testament, Brill Publishing and the editorial board of Vetus Testamentum are pleased to set the present collection before the learned public: ten articles published in the journal between 1950 and today, reprinted without change from the original. Most of them have been seminal in one way or another, and all, we think, continue to repay close study. The selection was made so as to illustrate the diversity of subject matter, scholarly approach, and geographic provenance that characterizes Vetus Testamentum.
