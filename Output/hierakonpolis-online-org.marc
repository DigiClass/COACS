Hierakonpolis, the City of the Hawk, ancient Egyptian Nekhen, is one of the most important archaeological sites for understanding the foundations of ancient Egyptian society. Best known as the home of the ceremonial Palette of Narmer, one of the first political documents in history, and attributed to the first king of the First Dynasty at about 3100BC, the site contains far more. Well before the construction of the pyramids, Hierakonpolis was one of the largest urban centers along the Nile -- a vibrant, bustling city containing many of the features that would later come to typify Dynastic Egyptian civilization. Stretching for over 3 km along the edge of the Nile flood plain, already by 3600 BC it was a city of many neighborhoods and quarters.00ahierakonpolis-online.orgdhttp://hierakonpolis-online.org/uhttp://hierakonpolis-online.org/
