There are very few resources on the language and this blog is a step to remedy that by providing an easier entry-point for other Ge'ez-aficionados! I hope you find it helpful in your work and I invite your corrections and suggestions for improvement.00aclassicalethiopic.blogspot.comdhttp://classicalethiopic.blogspot.com/uhttp://classicalethiopic.blogspot.com/2013/05/28-decipher-text-5-gospel-manuscript.html
