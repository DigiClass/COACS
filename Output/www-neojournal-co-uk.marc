A journal by students, for students. Our main objective here at NEO is to foster an academic journal specifically designed to publish the papers of Classics university students and early career researchers. We only publish work of the highest creativity and scholarly quality so that we might provide a reputable avenue for the first steps in an academic career and give our authors their first contact with the demanding standards of the scholarly world. Our double peer-review system assures the value of the papers that we publish and, by extent, the researcher that wrote it. We publish original graduate and undergraduate studies that may have arisen from university assessments or from papers presented at academic meetings and conferences. We believe that the opportunities created by this journal will provide additional motivation for students to excel in their studies whilst enabling us to exhibit some of the excellent work produced inside the Classics classroom. NEO - The Classics Students Journal invites submissions for inclusion in its first issue. NEO is an interdisciplinary Classics journal, however, an interdisciplinary approach is by no means required. All papers must be Classics focused and conform with the stipulated guidelines. See the full.00awww.neojournal.co.ukdhttp://www.neojournal.co.uk/uhttp://www.neojournal.co.uk/
