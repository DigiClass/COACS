Marie de France’s twelfth-century lai Bisclavret reveals the significance of the use of transparent technologies to construct a paradigm of the public versus private werewolf, human versus beast, Self versus Other, and illustrates the importance of these technologies to social perceptions and to one’s assertion of one’s own humanity, revealing that the human and the werewolf are not as different as the human attempts to profess. Both the human and werewolf are palimpsests: beings constructed from perceptions based on the addition and removal of layers of speech and clothing.00awww.vexillumjournal.orgdhttp://www.vexillumjournal.org/uhttp://www.vexillumjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Buckingham-Public-and-Private-Layers-of-Clothing-and-Tongue.pdf
