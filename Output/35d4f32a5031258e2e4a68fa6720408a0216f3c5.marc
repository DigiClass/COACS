The British Numismatic Journal (BNJ) is the Society's principal publication and has been published since 1903. The Society has recently made a complete digital archive of all issues of the BNJ to 2007 freely available available to download. New and recent volumes will be made available five years after publication. In late 2011, large PDF files of entire volumes were made freely available on the society's webspace. In 2012, the volumes have been split into their constituent articles and made available to search via the google bar below. Each volume can be accessed by clicking the links below. This will lead to a list of the individual articles in each, each of which can be individually dowloaded. You may download the whole volume but the files are very large and may take some time to download. All of the files are PDFs and will require a reader to access them. To download a reader for free (Adobe Acrobat) please click here. The volumes are arranged chronologically. If you are looking for a specific subject then you can either consult the Index of BNJ contents 1903-2010 or use the google search bar. This is a new resource and there are probably some errors within it. If you find any of these please report them to the.
