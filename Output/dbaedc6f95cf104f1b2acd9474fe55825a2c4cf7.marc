In the spirit of this positive form of assertion and in both technical and non-technical senses of the expression "defense mechanisms," the present issue of Classics@ has been given its title. The aim is to publish online research papers and essays in Classics and in other disciplines, related or unrelated, that explore strategies where the primary purpose is to defend assertively rather than attack. The justification is straightforward: discoveries and discovery procedures in research require and deserve a reasoned defense.00achs.harvard.edudhttp://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=ArticleWrapper&bdc=12&mn=1167uhttp://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=ArticleWrapper&bdc=12&mn=402600a9
