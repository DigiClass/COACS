The Maritime Archaeology Unit (MAU) was founded in 2001 under the aegis of the Mutual Heritage Centre. It is managed by the Central Cultural Fund and sponsored by the Netherlands Cultural Fund for specific projects. Following the early research and explorations connected with the Galle Harbour Project of 1992, the Central Cultural Fund (CCF) and the Department of Archaeology took the initiative to make maritime archaeologists and conservators out of the archaeology graduates from the relevant institutes and the universities. Our main intention is to develop the maritime archaeological field in Sri Lanka in order to protect our valuable underwater cultural heritage.00awww.mausrilanka.lkdhttp://www.mausrilanka.lk/publications/publications.htmluhttp://www.mausrilanka.lk/publications/images/MAU%20newsletter%20Oct%202011.pdf
