It promotes the coming together of history, literature, philosophy, religion, art, architecture and creative works inspired by the classics. Ephemeris was originally published between 2002-2004 and has now been revived in a fully on-line format. We accept submission from any undergraduate institution and look forward to a future of engaging with both traditional scholarly submissions and those made using the increasingly creative technologies provided by the on-line environment.
