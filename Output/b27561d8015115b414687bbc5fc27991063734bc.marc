Medicina Antiqua is hosted by the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL. It is devoted to the study of medicine in the Graeco-Roman world. It is intended to be a useful scholarly introduction and resource. It does this primarily either by including existing resources or linking to other web resources. The site currently hosts a number of essays and translations, which it is hoped will be expanded in the future. It is essentially dependent on submissions by academics or other interested parties.
