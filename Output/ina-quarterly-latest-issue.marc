Between 2008 and 2012, the Institute of Nautical Archaeology published The INA Annual, a year-end compilation of INA-supported projects, as a complement to the INA Quarterly. The time and work required to produce The INA Annual meant that it appeared at least one year later than the fieldwork reported within. So, in the interests of ensuring that news of INAâ€™s archaeological discoveries and fieldwork, book reviews, and dive safety features reach our loyal members in the shortest amount of time, we chose to suspend publication of The INA Annual in 2013 and return INA field reports to their traditional place on the pages of the INA Quarterly, which has been published four times a year for the past four decades.00anauticalarch.orgdhttp://nauticalarch.org/ina-annual/uhttp://nauticalarch.org/ina_quarterly/latest_issue/
