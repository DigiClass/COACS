Updated 20 September 2014]. Hortulus: The Online Graduate Journal of Medieval Studies is a multidisciplinary refereed postgraduate journal devoted to the literatures, cultures, and ideas of the medieval world. Published electronically twice a year, its mission is to present a forum in which graduate students from around the globe may share their work. Hortulus has an open submission policy, so submissions are accepted throughout the year. Graduate students are welcome to submit previously unpublished articles that challenge our readers to look at the Middle Ages from a variety of perspectives by engaging in new theories and interdisciplinary research. All articles should be submitted via email; submission guidelines can be found here. We publish a themed issue each spring, and a general issue each autumn. Calls for papers for each issue can be found on the main page of the website. There are also various position openings in Hortulus throughout the year so watch our social media outlets for information.00ahortulus-journal.comuhttp://hortulus-journal.com/
