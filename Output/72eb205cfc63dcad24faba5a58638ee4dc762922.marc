The motif of the reformed harlot is prevalent in medieval saints’ lives, but its implications are problematic. This paper begins to examine these implications by contrasting the lives of Mary of Egypt and Mary Magdalene, which circulated in France during the late thirteenth century, with the lives of contemporaneous women in poverty to find that they do not in fact resemble one another. Rather, this paper argues for a reinterpretation of the prostitute as an example for-but more importantly as a symbol of-the monks who comprised its audience. It then examines the impact of this symbol’s usage on gender and sexuality within the context of faith, including a monastic ideal of androgyny and erotic overtones in the desire for Christ, particularly in the form of communion. Finally, it contrasts the application of the symbol of the prostitute to monks and nuns, finding that the latter suffer from their affiliation in cases such as those of the Beguine sect, further emphasizing the gap between the saints and actual women, prostitutes or not, as well as their resemblance to male clerics.00awww.vexillumjournal.orgdhttp://www.vexillumjournal.org/uhttp://www.vexillumjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Loritz-The-Monastic-Symbolism-of-Prostitution-in-Late-Thirteenth-Century-France.pdf00a-
