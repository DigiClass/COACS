The Digital Pompeii Project is a joint venture of the Classical Studies Program, the Humanities Program, and the Center for Advanced Spatial Technology at the University of Arkansas. Its goal is the creation of a comprehensive database for visual art and material culture at Pompeii; the database will be linked with 3D models of the city that can be explored in real time. Currently, the project is focused on modeling the houses found in the Hauser in Pompeji series, as well as the Villa Arianna at Castellammare di Stabia, in conjunction with the Restoring Ancient Stabia foundation. The Project relies on a combination of traditional and CAD plans, and laser scanning data (for Villa Arianna). Primary software packages are Cinema 4D, ZBrush, and the game engine Unity.00apompeii.uark.edudhttp://pompeii.uark.edu/uhttp://pompeii.uark.edu/
