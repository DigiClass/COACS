Women in Judaism: A Multidisciplinary Journal. ISSN: 1209-9392. WOMEN IN JUDAISM: A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL is an academic, refereed journal published exclusively on the Internet, and devoted to scholarly debate on gender-related issues in Judaism. The ultimate aim of the journal is to promote the reconceptualization of the study of Judaism, by acknowledging and incorporating the roles played by women, and by encouraging the development of alternative research paradigms. Cross-methodological and interdisciplinary, the journal does not promote a fixed ideology, and welcomes a variety of approaches.00awjudaism.library.utoronto.cadhttp://wjudaism.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/wjudaism/indexuhttp://wjudaism.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/wjudaism/issue/view/34
