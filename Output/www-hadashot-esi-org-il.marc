The first digital publication of the journal (No. 116, 2004) is a reflection of the last printed volume. From 2005 onward, the journal will be published on-line only - each year will receive a volume number, continuing the numbering of the printed journal (e. g. , No. 117 = 2005, No. 118 = 2006, etc. ). The e-journal is an unlimited data base of archeological reports, including photographs, maps, plans and pottery figures. The reports can be searched by keywords or by means of an interactive map. The results of both types of searches can be printed.00awww.hadashot-esi.org.ildhttp://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/index_eng.aspuhttp://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/00a-
