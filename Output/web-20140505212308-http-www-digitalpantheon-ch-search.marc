Updated 23 April 2015 (linking now to the Internet Archive)]. The Ber(li)n Digital Pantheon Project. In October 2010 the Bern Digital Pantheon Project has moved to Berlin and is now part of the Excellence Cluster Topoi (www. topoi. org). The Bern Digital Pantheon Project was originally instigated in 2005 by Gerd Gra√ühoff as a pilot project of the Karman Center for Advanced Studies in the Humanities in Bern, Switzerland, hence its name. In October 2010 the project has moved to Berlin and is now continued within the cluster of excellence "Topoi" (www. topoi. org) which is devoted to the study of the formation and transformation of space and knowledge in ancient civilizations. The projects first objective was to undertake the long-overdue architectural survey of one of the most important buildings in the history of architecture. Accordingly, the interior and exterior of the Pantheon were measured in two campaigns in 2005 and 2007 using state-of-the-art laser scan technology.00aweb.archive.orgdhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140310173722/http://www.digitalpantheon.ch/uhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140505212308/http://www.digitalpantheon.ch/search
