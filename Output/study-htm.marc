Acta Terrae Septemcastrensis. ISSN 1583-1817. Acta Terrae Septemcastrensis is a yearly journal centred on the Transylvania heritage (from Neolithic, Bronze Age, Classical and Medieval archaeology). Additionally we publish proceedings related to our conferences we held (International Colloquium of Funerary Archaeology or The Carpathian Basin and its role in the Neolithisation of the Balkan Peninsula). Mainly we promote articles who integrate larger cultural waves in which we can see Transylvanian influences.00aarheologie.ulbsibiu.rouhttp://arheologie.ulbsibiu.ro/study.htm
