The Annual Meeting of Postgraduates in Ancient Literature (AMPAL) is one of the largest postgraduate conferences in ancient literature in the UK. It attracts international speakers from all around the globe, and provides an opportunity for the worldwide postgraduate community to interact and share research. Although it is a perfect medium for PhD students in later stages of their research to receive constructive feedback, it is also an ideal first conference, as it enables students to present their work in a friendly environment, develop presentation skills and encourage professional development. In the past, papers have been published both as special issues of journals, and as collected volumes in book format. We hope to continue this tradition and offer presenters an opportunity to publish in a peer-reviewed medium.00aojs.st-andrews.ac.ukuhttps://ojs.st-andrews.ac.uk/index.php/ampal/index
