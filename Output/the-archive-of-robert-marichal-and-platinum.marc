Towards a philological, literary, and historical approach to Latin papyri. The aim of PLATINUM is to scrutinize Latin texts on papyrus from several points of view in order to highlight their substantial contribution to our knowledge of innovations in ancient Roman literature, language, history, and society, especially in the multilingual and multicultural contexts of the Eastern part of the Empire between the 1st century B. C. and 8th century A. D. The first phase of the project will consist in assembling, updating and publishing critical editions, in order to present a new and more accurate corpus of Latin papyri on an easily accessible online platform. The second phase will be focused on providing the texts with a specific, pluridisciplinary commentary that gives new insights on Roman culture.00aplatinum-erc.itdhttps://platinum-erc.it/uhttps://platinum-erc.it/the-archive-of-robert-marichal-and-platinum/
