The journal is accessible free of charge to everyone, including non-members of the Paleoanthropology Society. In addition to the publication of articles, book reviews, and the abstracts of the annual meetings of the Society, the journal accepts commentaries on articles, summaries of current work in the various fields of paleoanthropology.
