ISSN: 2057-519X. The Postgraduate Journal of the Ironbridge International Institute for Cultural Heritage, University of Birmingham. This is a CFP for contributions to a new, open access, postgraduate/ graduate journal called furnace that is edited by young scholars in the Ironbridge International Institute for Cultural Heritage (IIICH) at the University of Birmingham. furnace hopes to be a facilitator for sparking debates and discussions surrounding the expanding and diversifying disciplinary field of cultural heritage. The journal’s title references the Institute’s close association with the Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage Site while suggesting the exciting percolations of new ideas that come together in intellectual crucibles - in this case, cultural heritage centres. This third issue of the journal is edited in collaboration with our partners at CHAMP (Collaborative for Cultural Heritage Management and Policy) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Since the establishment of their collaboration in 2012 both IIICH and CHAMP have sought to generate a series of research questions which examine Old World and New World perspectives on cultural heritage. Each side of the Atlantic - North and South - has unique geography, culture and history that is expressed through their individual heritage. Every day, however, people, objects and ideas flow backward and forward across the Atlantic, each shaping the heritage of the other for better or worse and each shaping the meanings and values that heritage conveys. Where, and in what ways are these Trans-Atlantic heritages connected? Where, and in what ways are they not? What can we learn from reflecting on the different contexts and cultures as they produce, consume, absorb, resist, and experience the heritage of the other?.00afurnacejournal.wordpress.comdhttps://furnacejournal.wordpress.com/uhttps://furnacejournal.wordpress.com/edition-one/issue-two/
