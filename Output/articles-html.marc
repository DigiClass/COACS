The Amarna period of Egyptian history began during the reign of the pharaoh Amenhotep III nearly 3,400 years ago. This was a period of tremendous artistic and architectural achievement. The famous Colossi of Memnon were built, wonderful additions were made to the temples at Luxor and Karnak, and seeds were sown for a monotheistic religion. Upon the death of Amenhotep III, his son Amenhotep IV became pharaon of Egypt. This "heretic king" changed his name to Akhenaten, quickly abandoned the pantheon of Egyptian gods and declared the sun-god, Aten, to be the only god. He and his queen, Nefertiti, built a new city, known as Akhetaten (Horizon of the Aten) at the present site of Tell el-Amarna. From there he ruled all Egypt and directed the worship of his one god, Aten. Following the death of Akhenaten, Tutankhamun (who was born Tutankh-aten, and is believed by a great many Egyptologists to have been Akhenaten's son), returned the religious capital of Egypt to Thebes. The monuments of the "heretic king" were destroyed and the memory of his reign was erased. But the eighteen year reign of Akhenaten had touched upon a religious philosophy and an artistic style that still echoes today. The Amarna Research Foundation is dedicated exclusively to the advancement of interest and research in the this fascinating slice of ancient history. 2015 Spring Vol 20 No 2. 2014 Fall Vol 20 No 2. 2014 Spring Vol 20 No 1. 2013 Fall Vol 19 No 2. 2013 Spring Vol 19 No 1. 2012 Fall Vol 18 No 2. 2012 Spring Vol 18 No 1. 2011 Fall Vol 17 No 2. 2011 Spring Vol 17 No 1. 2010 Fall Vol 16 No 2. 2010 Spring Vol 16 No 1. 2009 Fall Vol 15 No 2. 2009 Spring Vol 15 No 1. 2008 Fall Vol 14 No 2. 2008 Spring Vol 14 No 1. 2007 Spring Vol 13 No 1. 2006 Fall Vol 12 No 2. 2006 Spring Vol 12 No 1. 2005 Fall Vol 11 No 1 (2). 2005 Spring Vol 10 No 1. 2004 Spring Vol 9 No 1. 2003 Fall Vol 8 No 1 (2). 2003 Spring Vol 7 No 1. 2002 Fall Vol 6 No 2. 2002 Spring Vol 6 No 1. 2001 Fall Vol 5 No 2. 2001 Spring Vol 5 No 1. 2000 Fall Vol 4 No 3 (1). 1999 Fall Vol 4 (3) No 2. 1999 Spring Vol 4 No 1. 1998 Fall Vol 3 No 2. 1998 Spring Vol 3 No 1. 1997_Fall Vol 2 No 2. 1997 Spring Vol 2.
