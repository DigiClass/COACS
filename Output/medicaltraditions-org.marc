Clues for new medicines are hidden in old books reporting centuries of therapeutic experiences and practice. We trace these documents worldwide, decipher and interpret their texts, and repurpose their information for new scientific research. The Institute for the Preservation of Medical Traditions is a research centre at the interface of science, medicine, and the humanities, which bridges past and present, and inspires fresh investigations and innovative research strategies for tomorrowâ€™s health care.00amedicaltraditions.orgdhttp://medicaltraditions.org/uhttp://medicaltraditions.org/
