The NMCSU represents students at the University of Toronto enrolled in NMC courses and those working towards an NMC minor, major, or specialist. We serve as a liaison between students and faculty to help improve the student experience and make their voices heard.

We also process all NMC course evaluations to help students learn more about their courses and professors.
