Paraskevi Elefanti, Gilbert Marshall, Clive Gamble, 2015 The Prehistoric Stones of Greece set out to quantify and collate in as much detail as possible, information about Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites in Greece, and to describe the field survey projects which resulted in the discovery of the majority of these. Neolithic sites discovered during field survey were also recorded. Material culture including tools and other objects, structures and features, along with fauna and flora were documented, including those from later periods when from palimpsests or multi period sites. The aim was to create an overview of the results of many years of intensive field survey and to create a searchable archive with which to investigate regional settlement patterns and to identify likely areas for future research. The dataset includes information about sites and findspots including location, elevation, chronology, and the types of artefacts and ecofacts recovered. These have been standardised as far as possible to allow region wide comparisons and analysis of variability. The dataset is predominantly based on published accounts and occasionally grey literature from unpublished reports. In a small number of cases it has benefited from the results of our own research in Greece. New field survey projects continue to be set up and sites and findspots discovered, investigated and published. We endeavour to make the dataset as up to date as possible and continue to refine the records and to add new information as it becomes available.
