Welcome to MAGIS, an inventory of regional survey projects in the greater Mediterranean region. To search the database, please choose one of the options at the left. The Spatial Search allows users to zoom to a specific region of the Mediterranean or to view all projects currently entered (for which we have coordinates). The Google™ Earth Browse downloads an automatically updating. kmz file that, when opened in Google™ Earth 5. 0 or later, allows users to browse and interact with all survey projects in the MAGIS database for which spatial (coordinate) data are available. More info. The Database Search allows queries based on specific fields in the database. We also invite scholars to enter the metadata about their own projects by using the Data Entry form. Our Help pages offer detailed explanations about the search and data entry options, as well as browser support and the user interface. You can access the Help pages directly on each page by clicking on the symbol. If you have corrections to or comments about projects already in the system, please contact us at (a link to this address exists at the bottom of every page). Contact us at the same address if you are interested in the code developed for MAGIS. Thank you!.00acgma.depauw.edudhttp://cgma.depauw.edu/MAGIS/uhttp://cgma.depauw.edu/MAGIS/
