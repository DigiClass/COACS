ISSN: 0266 2442. Strata: The Bulletin of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society. Strata is an annual peer-reviewed academic journal that seeks to bring the latest studies of the archaeology of Israel-Palestine and its surrounding regions to a wider international audience. We welcome articles on many aspects of research that lead to a better understanding of the archaeology in this region, an archaeology that is of great interest internationally because of its significance both for understanding the development of three of the worldâ€™s great religions and for the important history of Israel-Palestine. We are also keen to have reviews of recently-published books studies on archaeological topics of the area. Until 2009, Strata was published continuously from 1982 as the Bulletin of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society, but with the addition of this headline - and a new cover - we hope to make it more easily recognisable in libraries and elsewhere. Strata articles also are widely available online in the Academic Search Premier (EBSCO) database, though note that these currently still remain categorised under the Bulletin of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society.
