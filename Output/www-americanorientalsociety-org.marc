From the beginning the Societyâ€™s aims have been humanistic. The encouragement of basic research in the languages and literatures of the Near East and Asia has always been central in its tradition, which has come to include such subjects as philology, literary criticism, textual criticism, paleography, epigraphy, linguistics, biography, archaeology, and the history of the intellectual and imaginative aspects of Eastern civilizations, especially of philosophy, religion, folklore and art.00awww.americanorientalsociety.orgdhttp://www.americanorientalsociety.org/uhttp://www.americanorientalsociety.org/
