Journal of the Jesus Movement in its Jewish Setting: from the first to the seventh century (JJMJS). ISSN: 2374-7862 (print). ISSN: 2374-7870 (online). JJMJS is a new interdisciplinary peer-reviewed online journal, published in cooperation with Eisenbrauns. A rich variety of Jewish and Christian traditions and identities mutually shaped one another in the centuries-long course of Roman Late Antiquity. A no less rich variety of scholarly approaches - from the history of Christian Origins to that of the late empire, from archaeology to Dead Sea Scrolls, from Rabbinics to Patristics - has in recent years converged upon this period, the better to understand its religious and social dynamics. JJMJS seeks to facilitate and to encourage such scholarly investigations across disciplinary boundaries, and to make the results of cutting-edge research available to a worldwide audience. JJMJS is free of charge with complete open access. The journal is published in cooperation with Eisenbrauns and will be available in hard copy, which can be ordered from Eisenbrauns.00awww.jjmjs.orguhttp://www.jjmjs.org/
