(Elizabeth Fentress and Adam Rabinowitz). The material contained in this website was originally intended to form Part 2 of the print publication An Intermittent Town: Excavations at Cosa, 1991-1997 (Ann Arbor 2003). The discussion of stratigraphy in this site is still intended to be integrated with the print publication, which contains both our interpretations of the data and the specialist studies of pottery, wall painting, sculpture, etc. The material presented in these pages may be useful even when read without reference to the print publication, but it is not meant to serve as a stand-alone work. Please read the website introduction for a discussion of our use of internet publishing.00awww.press.umich.edudhttp://www.press.umich.edu/webhome/cosa/index.htmluhttp://www.press.umich.edu/webhome/cosa/download.html
