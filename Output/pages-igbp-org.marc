PAGES (Past Global Changes) supports research which aims to understand the Earth’s past environment in order to obtain better predictions of future climate and environment, and inform strategies for sustainability. We encourage international and interdisciplinary collaborations and seek to promote the involvement of scientists from developing countries in the global paleo-community discourse. PAGES' scope of interest includes the physical climate system, biogeochemical cycles, ecosystem processes, biodiversity, and human dimensions, on different time scales - Pleistocene, Holocene, last millennium and the recent past. Over 5,500 scientists from more than 125 countries currently subscribe to PAGES. We encourage all interested scientists to get involved and contribute to our initiatives, participate in the workshops we support, and publish PAGES-relevant products. PAGES also organizes travel stipends for Guest Scientists.00apages-igbp.orgdhttp://pages-igbp.org/uhttp://pages-igbp.org/
