Résumé: "Transplanting trees from the peripheries to the center was a known leitmotiv in the Ancient Near East. Gardens served as a symbol of life, fertility, prosperity, change and power, and represented the integration of an "ideological" or a "geographical" expansion in Antiquity. The garden of Hatshepsut was a microcosm, which incorporated trees from Punt, symbolizing the ideological control of an "unknown" remote land, and the concrete elimination of "intermediaries" and "payments" to obtain these exotic goods.
