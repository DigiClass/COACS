The magazine as. is published quarterly in three languages and provides information about the latest discoveries, research results, exhibitions, experimental archaeology and much more and is written in a style that is easily understood by laypeople. Each issue is dedicated to a different core theme. There is a special edition on a region or a topic every year. The journal is the official newsletter of the Swiss Archaeological Society (formerly: the Society for Pre- and Protohistory, SGUF), which has been published since 1937 under the titles "Ur-Schweiz" (Prehistoric Switzerland), "Helvetia Archaeologica" and "Mitteilungsblatt SGUF" (SGUF Newsletter). After the Helvetia Archaeologica split off in 1976 to become an independent journal, the "Mitteilungsblatt SGUF" first appeared in its present-day form under the name "Archäologie der Schweiz" (Archaeology of Switzerland). "Archäologie Schweiz" (Archaeology Switzerland) (until 2005: "Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Ur- und Frühgeschichte" - Swiss Society for Pre - and Protohistory), founded in 1907, is a society with members in every linguistic region in Switzerland. A good half are amateurs with an interest in archaeology, the rest are experts, students and other interested bodies. Today, Archaeology Switzerland concentrates on two areas: firstly, communicating results to all interested parties, and secondly, carrying out archaeological projects involving multiple Swiss cantons.00aretro.seals.chuhttp://retro.seals.ch/digbib/en/vollist;jsessionid=A411CBE26B070F5985C515DB62A308D3?UID=ars-002&id=home&id2=browse4
