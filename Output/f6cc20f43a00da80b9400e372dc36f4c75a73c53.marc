ISSN: 0160-2810. [Early (out of copyright) content in JSTOR is free of paywall restrictions and open access]. Devoted to an examination of the civilizations of the Near East, the Journal of Near Eastern Studies has for 125 years published contributions from scholars of international reputation on the archaeology, art, history, languages, literatures, and religions of the Near East. Founded in 1884 as Hebraica, the journal was renamed twice over the course of the following century, each name change reflecting the growth and expansion of the fields covered by the publication. In 1895 it became the American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures, and in 1942 it received its present designation, the Journal of Near Eastern Studies. From an original emphasis on Old Testament studies in the nineteenth century, JNES has since broadened its scope to encompass all aspects of the vibrant and varied civilizations of the Near East, from the ancient to pre-modern Near East. A substantial book review section in every issue provides a critical overview of new publications by both emerging and established scholars.00awww.jstor.orgdhttp://www.jstor.org/action/showPublication?journalCode=hebraicauhttp://www.jstor.org/action/expandCollapseDecadeGroup?open=1880s&journalCode=hebraica#1880s
