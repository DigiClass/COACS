Besides a general introduction to text encoding, step-by-step tutorial modules provide example-based introductions to eight different aspects of electronic text markup for the humanities. Each tutorial module is accompanied with a dedicated examples section, illustrating actual TEI encoding practise with real-life examples. The theory of the tutorial modules can be tested in interactive tests and exercises. The tutorial materials are contextualised with a tools section, providing both an annotated overview of state-of-the-art XML encoding technology, and a TBE validator application, allowing you to test your TEI encoding as you type!.00atbe.kantl.bedhttp://tbe.kantl.be/TBE/TBE.htmuhttp://tbe.kantl.be/TBE/TBE.htm
