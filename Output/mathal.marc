ISSN: 2168-538X. Mathal/Mashal: Journal of Islamic and Judaic Multidisciplinary Studies (ISSN forthcoming) is a peer-reviewed, open access journal dedicated to scholarly discussion of topics present in the Islamic and Jewish traditions, cultures, and practices especially in the area where thematic and doctrinal aspects are common. The journal approaches these complex issues through interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary lenses. There are many topics that lend themselves to comparative studies but we will publish papers that deal with any of the topics in either of the traditions. Topics that can be discussed include Islamic and Jewish law, socio-economic and political history of the Islamic and Jewish communities, social and religious institutions, Tafsir and Rabbinic traditions, Midrash and/or Islamic and Jewish mysticism.
