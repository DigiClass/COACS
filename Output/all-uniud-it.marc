From the very beginning, the University of Udine has always valued the Latin language and literature offering courses in the curricula of the undergraduate and post-graduate degrees in Foreign Languages and Literatures. This Journal is a unique and original scientific initiative because it aims to overcome the current tendency towards divisive specialization among disciplines. In particular, the Journal welcomes submissions which investigate how classical languages are still essential and have been highly vital and influential throughout our modern world, from Humanism to Classicism, thus becoming the languages of the Modern world. A privileged focus will be given to language teaching and learning, since in Europe Latin has always been the language par excellence in schools and universities. More specifically, the Journal will focus on how present-day language theories influence the analysis of ancient and classical languages and are influenced by it. We hope that, thanks to its aims, scope and free on-line access, the Journal will represent a link between the world of school education and academia and will actively promote the connection between scientific research and language teaching.00aall.uniud.itdhttp://all.uniud.it/lam/uhttp://all.uniud.it/
