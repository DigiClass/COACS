ICAZ Newsletter (International Council for Archaeozoology). The ICAZ Newsletter is published biannually. Members are encouraged to submit information about recent news (such as field and laboratory projects, awards given or received), upcoming events (including conferences, workshops, or symposia), and job openings, grants, and fellowship opportunities. Each spring issue features a Recent Publications section compiled from member submissions. This section has been an extremely successful part of the newsletter with member publications numbering in the many thousands-a true testament to the vitality of archaeozoological research world-wide. A database of these publications is in preparation. ICAZ Newsletter submission deadlines are April 15 (Spring issue) and October 15 (Fall issue) For more information or to contribute to the newsletter, contact Newsletter Editor Angela Trentacoste at.
