An Open Access journal for the history of all forms of scientific thought and action, ancient and modern, in all regions of South Asia. See further, Focus and Scope. We take "South Asia" as an inclusive, non-political, socio-geographic term referring to the area from Afghanistan to Sri Lanka, from Pakistan to Bangladesh, and of course India. Research on the influences of South Asian cultures beyond these borders is also welcome, for example Nepalese or Tibetan influences on China, Sri Lankan influences on the Maldives, or Indian influences in South-East Asia. We take "science" to be broadly conceived, and to include all forms of rigorous intellectual activity that adopt at least to some extent a quantitative and empirical approach, as in the German "Die Wissenschaft," that covers most forms of academic scholarship. Theoretical discussions of the meaning of "science" in the South Asian context are welcome. They should presuppose some familiarity with topics such as those raised in sources like Grant, A History of Natural Philosophy (2007), Latour, Laboratory Life (1979), Staal, Concepts of Science in Europe and Asia</i> (1993, PDF), Shapin, "Science and the Modern World" (2007, PDF), Netz, The Shaping of Deduction (2003, PDF of review by Latour), Pollock, "The Languages of Science in Early-Modern India" (in Forms of Knowledge in Early Modern Asia, 2011), and similar reflective works that explore Global History, the interpretation of Modernities, and the general meaning of science in the pre-modern world. HSSA welcomes submissions for peer-review. Vol 3 (2015) Vol 2 (2014).00ahssa-journal.orguhttp://hssa-journal.org/
