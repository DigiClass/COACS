This definition clearly does not exclude notes on Alexander the Great, the Neo-Elamite period, etc. as long as they are relevant to the Achaemenid world. The content of texts submitted to ARTA may be research notes or short articles, announcements or reviews of publications, messages on congresses, exhibitions or excavations.
