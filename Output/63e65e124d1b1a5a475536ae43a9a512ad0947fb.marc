February 25, 2016 | By Brett Bobley I'm very pleased that the Office of Digital Humanities has teamed up with our colleagues in the NEH's Division of Research as well as our friends at the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to offer this new fellowship program. If you are a scholar doing research which will result in a digital publication, I urge you to consider applying to this program! Announcing the NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication. Great scholarship can be communicated in many forms - books and articles, of course, but also through multimedia, including interactive or enhanced ebooks, websites, audio clips, videos, and other formats. Today, we are also seeing scholarly presses begin to peer review and publish digital publications of various kinds. To help accelerate the creation of these new forms of scholarly communication, the National Endowment for the Humanities and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation are pleased to announce the NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication. This special opportunity with the NEH Fellowships program seeks to encourage scholars who are engaged in research leading to digital publications. For example, for scholarship in fields like art history, musicology, or media studies, an interactive digital publication may allow the author to use multimedia to make arguments or illustrate critical points that would be otherwise difficult or impossible in traditional print formats. NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication support individual scholars pursuing research projects that require digital expression and digital publication. To be eligible, the project must be conceived as digital because the nature of the research and the topics being addressed demand presentation beyond traditional print publication. Successful projects will likely incorporate visual, audio, and/or other multimedia materials or flexible reading pathways that could not be included in traditionally published books. Because NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication is a special opportunity within the larger NEH Fellowships competition, applications with be judged by the same criteria and held to the same standards of scholarly excellence. Applications received for the special opportunity will be evaluated by a separate peer review panel of scholars engaged with humanities research and knowledgeable about digital humanities/digital publications. Like the NEH Fellowships programs, NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication support continuous full-time work for a period of six to twelve months. Successful applicants receive a stipend of $4,200 per month. The maximum stipend is $50,400 for a twelve-month period. Applications are due by April 28, 2016.
