Vexillum is an undergraduate journal that supports and promotes undergraduate scholarship in the fields of Classical and Medieval Studies, and accepts scholarly papers by undergraduate students written on a wide range of topics: history, literature, philosophy, archaeology, art history, sociology, philology, and linguistics. Sponsored by the Medieval Studies Program at Yale University, Vexillum provides a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to submit outstanding papers for peer review from other undergraduates. Papers address aspects of the cultures and civilizations of Europe, the Mediterranean, the Near East, and Central Asia between 3,600 B. C. E. and 1500 C. E. As Vexillum has an open submission policy, the journal accepts submissions throughout the year. We publish an annual volume featuring the 8-12 most deserving of these submissions every fall. Undergraduates looking to submit their papers should read our Submission Guidelines prior to submission. We encourage them to submit unpublished articles with original ideas and interdisciplinary research that will foster scholarly discourse and distinguish themselves from their peers. Since 2010 it has been our aim to provide a venue for scholars early in their careers to showcase their work and contribute their fresh voices and perspectives to the academic world at large.
