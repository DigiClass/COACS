You may browse and search the materials of this site but you may not download them. The Abridged TLG provides access to a number of works from authors such as Homer, Hesiod, Plato, Aristotle, the Greek tragedians and orators that have traditionally been used in college level instruction of Greek. Realizing that small undergraduate programs in Classics may not be able to subscribe to the full version of the TLG, we have included in this subcorpus a representative selection of texts that will satisfy the needs of students and non-experts wishing to study Greek. In addition, this site contains editions that have been replaced by newer or different ones. To view Greek, please make sure a polytonic Greek font is installed in your system and selected in the preferences of your browser.
