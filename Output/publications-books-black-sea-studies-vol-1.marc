The Black Sea, known to the Greeks as Pontos Euxeinos or the "Hospitable Sea", is the focus of this series, which is concerned with ethnic relations, cultural interaction, and economic interdependence in the Black Sea region in the period c. 700 BC-AD 325, but with a main focus on the years ca. 400 BC-100 AD. Although the Black Sea region is viewed as a whole, attention is concentrated on the north and south coasts of the Black Sea region, i. e. of modern Russia, Ukraine and Turkey. Publications devote special attention to centre-periphery relations, to cultural interaction as an expression of ethnic and cultural strategies, and the analyses are based on a long-term view of the Black Sea region as a link between Asia and Europe. All the articles in the books can be downloaded as read-only pdf-files.00awww.pontos.dkdhttp://www.pontos.dk/publications/books/black-sea-studies-vol-1uhttp://www.pontos.dk/publications/books/black-sea-studies-vol-1
