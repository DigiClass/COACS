The Egypt Exploration Society YouTube Channel. The EES was founded in 1882 by the writer and traveller Amelia Edwards to explore and document ancient Egyptian sites and monuments, and to create a lasting record of the remains as a means of preserving them. This work, begun by Amelia, Flinders Petrie, Howard Carter and many other great archaeologists, continues to this day. In the last 130 years the EES has explored hundreds of sites in Egypt, uncovering temples, tombs and entire towns and cities. Part of our mission is to generate enthusiasm for Egypt's past and to raise awareness of the importance of protecting its sites and monuments. We are captivated by the stories of the great pharaohs and their people and want to share what our experts have learned about how they lived with as wide an audience as possible. We rely almost entirely on public support to fund our work and we need your help to ensure that we continue to carry out our mission at a time when Egypt's heritage is as threatened as it has been since Amelia's day Current content includes (among other things) the EES Oral History Project.00awww.youtube.comdhttp://www.youtube.com/user/EgyptExplorSocietyuhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq_oUWbfuCo
