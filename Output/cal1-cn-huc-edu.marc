There is no indication that the identity of any of our users was looked for or their own privacy comprised in any way. The length of the delay is a direct function of the fact that we have failed to have any NEH funding renewed for many years now and the CAL continues on solely as a labor of love without any paid researchers.00acal1.cn.huc.edudhttp://cal1.cn.huc.edu/uhttp://cal1.cn.huc.edu/
