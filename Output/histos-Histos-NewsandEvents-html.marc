Updated 27 August 2016]. Histos: The On-line Journal of Ancient Historiography. Histos, the on-line journal of ancient historiography, was founded in 1996 by John Moles, then of the University of Durham, who was also its Editor, supported by an Editorial Board of scholars from the UK and North America. Four issues appeared from 1997 to 2000, and many of the articles that appeared during those years have since become standard works in the study of ancient historiography. The website for Histos was hosted by the University of Durham from 1996 to 2011. In 2010 a decision was made to re-start Histos, under the editorship of John Moles, now of the University of Newcastle, and with the addition of John Marincola, of Florida State University, as co-editor. The new site, now hosted by the University of Newcastle, was launched in June 2011, and the earlier material from volumes 1 to 4 was transferred to the new site, the older contributions having been converted from HTML format to PDF. The brief of HISTOS is rapid publication of high-quality articles and notes on all aspects of ancient historiography and biography (including Jewish historiography, the Gospels and later Christian material) and of in-depth reviews of recent publications in the field. It is not our intention to publish material which is per se historical, unless it illuminates the qualities of ancient historians or biographers (this will be a matter of balance and judgment). All submissions will be anonymously refereed by experts. We aim for a turn-around time of a maximum of three months. We will publish in English, French, German and Italian. HISTOS will be available both online, in a full open-access version (in PDF form), and in a printed version. All the papers accepted for publication will appear in both formats. Readers' responses are welcomed.00aresearch.ncl.ac.ukdhttp://research.ncl.ac.uk/histos/index.htmluhttp://research.ncl.ac.uk/histos/Histos_NewsandEvents.html
