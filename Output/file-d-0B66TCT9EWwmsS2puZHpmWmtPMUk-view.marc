Alkow Department of Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Cultures and the Sonia and Marco Nadler Institute of Archeology. Tel Aviv University. January 2017 The newsletter of the Sonia and Marco Nadler Institute of Archaeology and the Department of Archaeology and Near Eastern Cultures, Tel-Aviv University, is a great opportunity to present the people, the achievements, the research and publications, conducted in the largest and most dynamic archaeological institution operating in Israel today, both in the quantity and quality of research. The mission of the Institute and the Department is to study and to teach the archaeology of the Land of Israel, the Levant and the major Ancient Near Eastern cultures (Egyptian, Mesopotamian and. Anatolian) in pre- and proto-historic times, in the Bronze and Iron Ages, and up to the classical periods. We hope that this newsletter will reflect our activities and achievements, our research, teaching, publications and our students, and will present the people who stand behind them. They, after all, are our real treasure.
