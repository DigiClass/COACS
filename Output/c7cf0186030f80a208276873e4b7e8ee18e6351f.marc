Updated 7 May 2014]. Studies in Ancient Art and Civilization. ISSN: 0083-4300. Studies in Ancient Art and Civilization were created in 1991 as an irregular series which in the first place served as a forum for the presentation of the Jagiellonian University Institute of Archaeology and studies provided by its researchers. The series was originated by professor Joachim Śliwa, who was also its first Editor in Chief, and since 2010 this function has been fulfilled by professor Ewdoksia Papuci-Władyka. Since vol. 10 (2007) SAAC has become a regular yearly periodical. Until present fifteen volumes have been published, among them two monographic studies (vols. 3 and 11, the latter being Pontika 2006 conference proceedings edited by E. Papuci-Władyka) and three volumes dedicated to distinguished researchers from our Institute on occasion of their jubilees (vols. 8 - professor Maria Ludwika Bernhard, 14 - professor Joachim Śliwa and 15 - professor Janusz A. Ostrowski). SAAC publishes papers in the fields of archaeology, art and civilization of ancient Egypt, the Near East, Greece and its colonies, Cyprus and Rome, as well as other, non-Mediterranean ancient civilizations, and also in history of archaeology, collecting of antiquities and reception of ancient culture in modern Europe. Special attention is being given to topics concerning predynastic and early-dynastic Egypt, the Greek and Roman periods in the Black Sea region, and archaeology of Cyprus, due to the excavations conducted by researchers from our Institute in these areas. Objects and artefacts from these excavations are being published in SAAC. Since 2011 (vol. 15) the publisher has been Księgarnia Akademicka Ltd. in Krakow. Starting with volume 16 (2012) external review procedure will be introduced, compliant to the double-blind review process (anonymity of both reviewed author and reviewer). The referees will be both members of the Editorial Board and other researchers. The list of referees will be published on the journal’s website. All SAAC volumes as well as other publications are available on the library exchange base. Recent issues can be purchased at the Księgarnia Akademicka, also in e-book format (www. akademicka. pl).00awww.farkha.nazwa.pldhttp://www.farkha.nazwa.pl/saac/uhttp://www.farkha.nazwa.pl/saac/?page_id=5300a12
