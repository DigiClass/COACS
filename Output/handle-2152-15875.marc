Kober Papers0#aOpen access2#aAlice E. Kober Papers. Alice E. Kober (1906-1950) was a Classical scholar and academician whose fastidiously detailed and documented lifeâ€™s work contributed to the decipherment of Linear B. Until just days before her death from cancer at the age of 43, she employed a unique heuristic approach that proved conclusively the Mycenaean script (circa 1500-1100 BC) is inflected. Her findings and methods were subsumed by Michael Ventris (1922-1956) who in 1952 successfully deciphered Linear B as a syllabic language of archaic Greek etymology. Research material, publications, manuscripts, lectures, correspondence, and professional material are included in the approximately 188,825 items that comprise the Alice E. Kober Papers (1932-1950) of the Program in Aegean Scripts and Prehistory. The bulk of the items support the decipherment of Linear B while correspondence, lectures, and professional material add context to the research material.00arepositories.lib.utexas.edudhttps://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/15875uhttps://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/15875
