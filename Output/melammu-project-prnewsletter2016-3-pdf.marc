The main purpose of the Melammu Project is to investigate the continuity, transformation, and diffusion of Mesopotamian and Ancient Near Eastern culture from the third millennium BCE through the ancient world until Islamic times and after. Additionally, the Project studies the comparison of Mesopotamian and Ancient Near Eastern culture to cultural aspects found elsewhere, both in contemporary and different time periods. Finally, the Project is also interested in how Mesopotamian and Ancient Near Eastern culture lives on in and has influenced the modern world. The decision to start producing Melammu Project Newsletters was made at Melammu Symposia 8.
