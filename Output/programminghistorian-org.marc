We regularly publish new lessons, and we always welcome proposals for new lessons on any topic. Our editorial mentors will be happy to work with you throughout the lesson writing process. If you’d like to be a reviewer or if you have suggestions to make Programming Historian a more useful resource, please see our Contribute page. Our Project Team and peer reviewers work collaboratively with authors to craft tutorials that illustrate fundamental digital and programming principles and techniques. We have lessons on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Data Management, Data Manipulation, Distant Reading, Mapping and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Network Analysis, Digital Exhibit Building, Programming, and Web Scraping, and more. Our tutorials include nearly a dozen lessons on popular DH tools such as MALLET, Omeka, and QGIS. If you can’t find what you’re looking for, we welcome your feedback. Better yet, contribute a lesson!
