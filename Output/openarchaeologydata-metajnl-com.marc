Updated 21 August 2015]. Journal of Open Archaeology Data (JOAD). ISSN: 2049-1565. The Journal of Open Archaeology Data (JOAD) features peer reviewed data papers describing archaeology datasets with high reuse potential. We are working with a number of specialist and institutional data repositories to ensure that the associated data are professionally archived, preserved, and openly available. Equally importantly, the data and the papers are citable, and reuse will be tracked. While still in beta phase, the journal is now accepting papers. We will also be adding new functionality over the next few weeks, and refining the look and feel. Vol 4 (2015).00aopenarchaeologydata.metajnl.comuhttp://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/
