Spearheading CyI’s contribution to the rich cultural heritage of Cyprus the creation of the digital library Dioptra provides the necessary advanced technological framework to support the management and international dissemination of an array of projects, collaborations and initiatives. Inspired by the ancient astronomical and surveying instrument, Dioptra is named in honor of CyI’s Trustee Mrs Edmée Leventis as a small recognition of her invaluable support to the Institute’s research efforts in archaeology, the arts cultural heritage. The framework of Dioptra fosters collaborations with major Cultural Heritage stakeholders in the region creating a unique and wide research network with an extraordinary momentum for future activities. Dioptra is based on a digital platform that develops in modules dedicated in the study of various aspects of Cypriot cultural heritage. The completion of the Digital Ancient Cypriot Literature project has offered the first module with others following such as projects on the Cypriot Archaeological Collections in Foreign Museums and the work of Byzantine Artist Theodore Apseudis.00adioptra.cyi.ac.cydhttp://dioptra.cyi.ac.cy/uhttp://dioptra.cyi.ac.cy/?q=Drupal_Module_RTI
