Quarterly Report: December 2010 - by Sean Gillies - last modified Nov 09, 2012 12:23 AM The Pleiades project has enjoyed a successful and productive first half-year under NEH funding.

Pleiades 2 Final Performance Report: July 2014 - by Tom Elliott - last modified Aug 07, 2014 03:04 PM In funding NYU’s request for 3 years’ support of the Pleiades project, the National Endowment for the Humanities endorsed the goal we articulated in our proposal: to attract, engage, and retain the animated community of users (scholars, students, and enthusiasts alike) that had begun to coalesce around Pleiades’ then-unique model of online, open historical geography. We sought to deliver not only a free website and dataset, but an active user community, capable of carrying on collaborative content curation for many years to come. We are happy to report that we have succeeded in meeting this goal.
