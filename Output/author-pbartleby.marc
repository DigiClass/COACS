DIY Classics is a Latin & Greek literature blog. It is based on the "comparative method"-that is, the idea that the languages should be treated together in such a way that each language informs the other. It is run by Patrick J. Burns, a PhD candidate in Classics at Fordham University. You can follow him on Twitter at @diyclassics.00adiyclassics.comdhttps://diyclassics.com/uhttps://diyclassics.com/author/pbartleby/
