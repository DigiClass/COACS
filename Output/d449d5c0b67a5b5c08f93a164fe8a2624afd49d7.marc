Abuse has of course been widely studied, and in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in abuse as a broader cultural and literary phenomenon, but there are reasonable restrictions as to how it has been addressed. One goal of this volume is to initiate a scholarly discussion that will allow greater heterogeneity in the material covered and in the theoretical models brought to bear on that material. Another is to encourage experimentation and collaborative exchange among scholars working in seemingly unconnected fields. Most importantly, perhaps, we would like to foster a deeper understanding of the role of abuse in all of Greek literature, across genres and time periods, through the kind of cumulative knowledge that comes from collaborative work in different fields.00achs.harvard.edudhttp://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=ArticleWrapper&bdc=12&mn=1167uhttp://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=ArticleWrapper&bdc=12&mn=513900a11
