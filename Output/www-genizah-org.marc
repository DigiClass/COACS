Following are some of the additional data and improvments that have been integrated into the website, since the previous announcement of version 8 in July 2011. A - ImagesCambridge: Since the last announcement about 4 months ago, an additional set of 40,214 images from the CUL Genizah Collection has been integrated in the website, mostly from the collections TS AR, AS, NS, and Or. 2118, bringing the total number of images of Genizah fragments from Cambridge to almost 258,000 images. British Library: An additional set of 316 images has been integrated in the website. JTS (Jewish Theological Seminary - New York): A set of 1065 images has been received and integrated, most of them new images, others being improved versions of existing images. The total number of images in the website is currently about 320,000 images. B - Software1. Joins: Information (and statistics) about joins occur now in many pages of the website, from which it was missing, including in the "results" pages of of an advanced search. 2. Images: Two important new functions are now available: a|) after processing an image in ViewOne using the "sun" icon to adjust for optimal contrast, brightness and luminance, the image with the new settings can be saved in the user's workspace for future viewing, b) after rotating a given image in the QuickView function either for straightening it or for allowing easy reading of oblique lines, the image can be send in its new position to ViewOne to be viewed and processed there using the rich repertoire available in ViewOne for such processing; it will be then saved also in the personal workspace for later viewing. 3. Scanned catalogs: New scanned catalog-entries from the Zulay and Widder catalogs about Budapest fragments have been integrated. 4. Institutional registration: A new and straightforward registration system has been implemented for libraries, that enables free and immediate access to the Genizah website for libraries' visitors from up to 20 pcs in that library. 5. Various improvements: a) frames: the "Frames" structure through which users can add restrictions to the search has been greatly improved and better adapted to the nature of the Domains and the specific structure of the Titles involved; also a better separation between the body of a work and its appended information (preface, appendices, table of contents, etc) has been implemented, b) statistics: the statistical tables that appear in each function section and give a detailed overview of the available information in that section have been greatly enlarged and improved, c) workspace: various icons for specific types of information are now available in the workspace, d) forum: an improved filtering operation is now available for all the notes in the forum, e) restrictions: the time allocated for idle operation has been increased from 40 to 60 minutes. Remarks:1) We remind our readers that accredited users can add new information (including "joins") on Genizah fragments to the website (which will appear there with their name appended to it), through the FOLUS system. We urge such users to use this opportunity to enrich the website with new data, to the benefit of the entire Genizah-studies community. Other users who would like to contribute in such a way are kindly asked to send us in email through the "contact us" icon. 2) The users are also encouraged to use the public forum to present new insights, submit queries, open discussions, etc; on Genizah issues; take a look at it now!3) We remind our users that the Nahum website is available and can be reached through the Genizah website, as well as directly through http://www. jewishmanuscripts. org/. It contains almost 100,000 high-quality digital images of Yemenite manuscripts from the Nachum collection, as well as catalog and other data, that can searched and processed using essentially the same tools as available in the |Genizah website.
