ISSN: 2360-266X. The Journal of Ancient History and Archaeology is seeking to publish profound, rigorous, well-written, high-quality, high-impact papers to generate discussion, debate, fresh perspective. The research area is the European continent and the Near East in the Greek-Roman times. The topics are: ancient history, ancient philology, epigraphy, papyrology, numismatics, archaeological material, archaeological reports, digital archaeology, archaeometry, reviews. We intend to have four issues per year. We strongly encourage the interdisciplinary or ‘bridge-building’ approach of different academic disciplines. We will use a peer-review system. The readers will have free access and a pdf version of the published materials will be available for download. We want to make the Journal of Ancient History and Archaeology a ‘must read’ publication for those who want to learn more about Ancient History.00ajaha.org.rouhttp://jaha.org.ro/index.php/JAHA/index
