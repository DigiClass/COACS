Thrace - modern Bulgaria, Northern Greece, and European Turkey - is an ancient region distinguished by 800 years of interesting coinage which includes a rich variety of types. The goal of the project, funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) for three years, is a numismatic web portal. Thracian coins found in museums and private collections throughout the world will be virtually collected in this online database that is free and open to the public. The portal is initially based on the collection of plaster casts from the research project for Greek coins (Griechische Münzwerk) at the Berlin Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities together with the coin collection from the Berlin Münzkabinett. Additionally it is possible for museums and collections as well as for private persons to digitally document and publish their collections through the portal. This digital publication, including a recognizable reference number, image, weight, and repository information, is an effective measure that can be taken to protect ancient cultural heritage.00awww.corpus-nummorum.eudhttp://www.corpus-nummorum.eu/uhttp://www.corpus-nummorum.eu/
