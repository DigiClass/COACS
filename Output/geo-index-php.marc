It contains the currently 197357 attestations of toponyms in texts from Egypt (BC 800 - AD 800), but is also linked to the provenance field in Trismegistos Texts0#aOpen access2#aFinally, because abbreviations are often different in the various disciplines, we have also started creating a Bibliography which resolves many of the short references we use in Trismegistos. The other way round it also wants to facilitate the search for all texts in a specific publication. Its coverage is patchy except for the publications dealing with Demotic and Abnormal Hieratic, where the Demotistische Literatur√ºbersicht provides a much higher standard of bibliographic information.00awww.trismegistos.orgdhttp://www.trismegistos.org/uhttp://www.trismegistos.org/geo/index.php
