The primary purpose of the Agora Picture Book series is to enliven the experience of a visitor to the Athenian Agora, excavated by the American School since 1931. While drawing on the object and monuments that can be viewed on a visit to the site, these well-illustrated guides attempt to add some human color to the dry material remains. A number of the concise guides have become popular supplementary texts for undergraduate and graduate classes in classical civilization. Since 1998 the Picture Books have been published in color. 1: Pots and Pans of Classical Athens - by Brian A. Sparkes and Lucy Talcott. 2: The Stoa of Attalos II in Athens - by Homer A.
