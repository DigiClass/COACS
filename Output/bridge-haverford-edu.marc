The Bridge enables students and instructors to generate customized vocabulary lists from its database of Greek and Latin textbooks and texts. A list might include all the vocabulary from a core list, an ancient text, or a textbook. But users can focus on a selection of a list or work and also customize their lists to take into account textbooks that they have used, core lists they have mastered, and texts they have already read. These lists can then be filtered to focus on one or more parts of speech, among other options, and then printed or downloaded in a variety of formats.00abridge.haverford.edudhttp://bridge.haverford.edu/uhttp://bridge.haverford.edu/
