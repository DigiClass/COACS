BIBLIOGRAPHIES BY TOPICIn order to understand fully the damage that has occurred to Syrian cultural heritage sites, it is important to obtain a comprehensive understanding of these sites prior to the civil conflict that began in 2011. Academic publications, excavation reports, archaeological surveys, and damage assessments are just some of the many sources that can paint a broad picture of pre-conflict cultural heritage in Syria, which in turn proves instrumental to our documentation efforts and preservation planning. Below you will find a series of bibliographies that contain both published and unpublished works in a variety of languages, including English, Arabic, French, German, and Italian, among others. We encourage you to seek out these sources and to learn more about the cultural heritage that is currently at risk.00awww.asor-syrianheritage.orgdhttp://www.asor-syrianheritage.org/resources/bibliographies/uhttp://www.asor-syrianheritage.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/St.-Simeons-Bibliography.pdf
