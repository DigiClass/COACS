The project Pomoerium will focus on the achievements of classics-related sciences, and examine socio-economic and religious transformations, not as a stream of disjointed events, but as an intelligible and determinate process, whether involving a shorter or a longer time span. It constitutes the efforts to render accessible to the interested public hardly-known ideas, journals and books and aims to contribute to the exploration and understanding of religious and socio-economic processes in the classical antiquity and provide an interdisciplinary forum for the discussion of their various aspects. Finally it serves furthermore as a naturally forum for the presentation and discussion of noteworthy issues, including the presentation of minority or at times controversial points of view.00awww.pomoerium.euuhttp://www.pomoerium.eu/pomoer.html
