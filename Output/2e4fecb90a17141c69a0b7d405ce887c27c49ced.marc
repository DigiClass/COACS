"This is the history of events from the reign of the emperor Nerva to the death of Valens, which I, a former soldier and a Greek (miles quondam et Graecus), have composed to the best of my ability. It claims to be the truth, which I have never ventured to pervert either by silence or a lie. " (Amm. Marc. 31. 16. 9). "an accurate and faithful guide, who has composed the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which usually affect the mind of a contemporary" (Edward Gibbon). "Ammianus is. a great historian, a man of penetrating intelligence and of remarkable fairness. " (A. H. M. Jones). "the greatest literary genius that the world produced between Tacitus and Dante" (Stein). This site introduces Ammianus and his work by means of a biography, short essays on important persons in and aspects of his work, a bibliography of important and recent publications. The site is under permanent construction. Suggestions for improvement, additions to the bibliography and short essays are very welcome.
