### Cataloguing Open Access Classics Serials ###

**Project team:**

 * Gabriel Bodard (Institute of Classical Studies, University of London)
 * Simona Stoyanova (Institute of Classical Studies, University of London)

The Cataloguing Open Access Classics Serials (COACS) project will leverage the various sites that list or index open access (OA) publications, especially journals and serials in classics and ancient history, to produce a resource that subject libraries may use to automatically catalogue the publications and articles therein. The project is based in the ICS, in collaboration with the Combined Library of the Hellenic and Roman Societies, and in consultation with the Warburg Institute, the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (NYU) and the German Archaeological Institute.
