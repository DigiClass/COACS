### Cataloguing Open Access Classics Serials ###

**Project team:**

 * Gabriel Bodard (Institute of Classical Studies, University of London), PI, Digital Humanities
 * Joanna Ashe (Hellenic and Roman Library), PI, Library Science
 * Simona Stoyanova (Institute of Classical Studies, University of London), Research Associate (2017–2019)

The Cataloguing Open Access Classics Serials (COACS) project will leverage the various sites that list or index open access (OA) publications, especially journals and serials in classics and ancient history, to produce a resource that subject libraries may use to automatically catalogue the publications and articles therein. The project is based in the ICS, in collaboration with the Combined Library of the Hellenic and Roman Societies, and in consultation with the Warburg Institute, the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (NYU) and the German Archaeological Institute.

COACS has been funded by a development grant from the School of Advanced Study to the Institute of Classical Studies, and a resource grant from the Classical Association to the Hellenic and Roman Library.
